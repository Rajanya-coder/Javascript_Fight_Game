# Javascript_Fight_Game ⚔️

A simple **multiplayer fighting game** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and basic **Socket.IO** integration.

Players control characters to battle each other.  
Currently, gameplay is rendered in the browser and game events (like win/loss) are sent through Socket.IO.  
Real-time synchronized player movements are planned for future updates.
